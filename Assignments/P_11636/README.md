### Description:

Input
The input file can contain up to 2000 lines of inputs. Each line contains an integer N (0 < N < 10001)
that denotes the number of “Hello World!” lines are required to be printed.
Input is terminated by a line containing a negative integer.
Output
For each line of input except the last one, produce one line of output of the form ‘Case X: Y ’ where
X is the serial of output and Y denotes the minimum number of paste commands required to make a
program that prints N lines of “Hello World!”.

### Solution
To solve this problem,
I used 3 functions , 
- function 1 - RECEIVE VECTOR OF INTEGERS
- function 2 - MAIN, read user data
- function 3 - main, reading the file and displaying the results
