### Description:

10035 Primary Arithmetic
Children are taught to add multi-digit numbers from right-to-left one digit at a time. Many find the
“carry” operation - in which a 1 is carried from one digit position to be added to the next - to be a
significant challenge. Your job is to count the number of carry operations for each of a set of addition
problems so that educators may assess their difficulty.
Input
Each line of input contains two unsigned integers less than 10 digits. The last line of input contains ‘0
0’.

### Solution
To solve this problem,
I used 2 functions , 
- function 1 - process and display rresults
- function 2 - main, reading user data
