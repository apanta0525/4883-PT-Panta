### Description:

Problems in Computer Science are often classified as belonging to a certain class of problems (e.g.,
NP, Unsolvable, Recursive). In this problem you will be analyzing a property of an algorithm whose
classification is not known for all possible inputs.
algorithm tpo consider:
  1. input n
  2. print n
  3. if n = 1 then STOP
  4. if n is odd then n ←− 3n + 1
  5. else n ←− n/2
  6. GOTO 2

### Solution
To solve this problem,
I used two functions , one to check number of cycles and the other to loop through i and j
